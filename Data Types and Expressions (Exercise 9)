#You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge. 
#Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints the cube’s surface area as output
#change equation for anything other than cube's.
######################

import math
# Request the input
r = int(input("Please enter the edge length: \n"))

# Compute the surface area =  2π r h + 2π r²
surface_area = (6*r*r)

# Display the surface area
print(surface_area)

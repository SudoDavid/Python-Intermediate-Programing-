# Write a program that takes as input a number of kilometers and 
# prints the corresponding number of nautical miles. Use the following approximations:

#A kilometer represents 1/10,000 of the distance between the North Pole and the equator.
#There are 90 degrees, containing 60 minutes of arc each, between the North Pole and the equator.
#A nautical mile is 1 minute of an arc.

# Taking kilometers input from the user
kilometers = float(input("Enter value in kilometers: "))

# conversion factor
conv_fac = 0.54

# calculate miles
Nm = kilometers * conv_fac
print(Nm)
